📝 Important Note
First, try to create layouts using only the PDF reference images.
If you don't understand after trying, then check the code for help.
If you understand the concept, continue building on your own.
OK 👍

🆘 When to Check Code:
❌ If stuck for more than 15-20 minutes

❌ If layout doesn't look like reference image

❌ If CSS positioning concepts are unclear

✅ When to Continue Alone:
✅ If you understand the layout structure

✅ If you can visualize the CSS approach

✅ If you're making good progress

Remember: The goal is learning, not just completing! 🎯
